Even more importantly, the concept of an active metal that can undergo an optical nonvolatile transition has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that antimony (Sb), a pure metal, is optically distinguishable between two programmable states as nanoscale thin films. We show that these states, corresponding to the crystalline and amorphous phases of the metal, are stable at room temperature. Crucially from an application standpoint, we demonstrate both its optoelectronic modulation capabilities and switching speed using single subpicosecond pulses. The simplicity of depositing a single metal portends its potential for use in any optoelectronic application where metallic conductors with an actively tunable state are important.","tags":[],"title":"Antimony thin films demonstrate programmable optical nonlinearity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiang He","Nathan Youngblood","Zengguang Cheng","Xiangshui Miao","Harish Bhaskaran"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652364198,"objectID":"54346334f8abf4cf71a4a9bff3b8f8f9","permalink":"https://zgcheng-lab.github.io/publication/journal_publications/he-2020/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T14:03:18.793657Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_publications/he-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Structural color filters (i.e. plasmonics and nano-cavities) provide vivid and robust color filtering in applications such as CMOS image sensors but lack simplicity in fabrication and dynamic tuning.

The transmitted color spectrum can be designed over the entire visible range and shifted by around 50\u0026#x2005;nm after phase transition.

However, it is the performance of the hardware, in particular the energy efficiency of a computing system that sets the fundamental limit of the capability of machine learning. Data-centric computing requires a revolution in hardware systems, since traditional digital computers based on transistors and the von Neumann architecture were not purposely designed for neuromorphic computing. A hardware platform based on emerging devices and new architecture is the hope for future computing with dramatically improved throughput and energy efficiency. Building such a system, nevertheless, faces a number of challenges, ranging from materials selection, device optimization, circuit fabrication and system integration, to name a few. The aim of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of emerging hardware technologies that are potentially beneficial for machine learning, providing the Nanotechnology readers with a perspective of challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field.","tags":[],"title":"Roadmap on emerging hardware and technology for machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolaos Farmakidis","Nathan Youngblood","Xuan Li","James Tan","Jacob L.

This fact has long been realized in the communications field, where optical signaling is the norm. However, exploiting optical signaling in computing will require new on-chip devices that work seamlessly in both electrical and optical domains, without the need for repeated electrical-to-optical conversion. Phase-change devices can, in principle, provide such dual electrical-optical operation, but assimilating both functionalities into a single device has so far proved elusive owing to conflicting requirements of size-limited electrical switching and diffraction-limited optical response. Here, we combine plasmonics, photonics, and electronics to deliver an integrated phase-change memory cell that can be electrically or optically switched between binary or multilevel states. Crucially, this device can also be simultaneously read out both optically and electrically, offering a new strategy for merging computing and communications technologies.","tags":[],"title":"Plasmonic nanogap enhanced phase-change devices with dual electrical-optical functionality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Syed Ghazi Sarwat","Zengguang Cheng","Nathan Youngblood","Mohd Sharizal Alias","Sapna Sinha","Jamie Warner","Harish Bhaskaran"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652364199,"objectID":"31deda8bb98d370cf832531de9463411","permalink":"https://zgcheng-lab.github.io/publication/journal_publications/sarwat-2019/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T14:03:19.606511Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_publications/sarwat-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Chalcogenide glasses as nanoscale thin films have become leading candidates for several optical and photonic technologies, ranging from reflective displays and filters to photonic memories. Current material systems, however, show strong optical absorption which limits their performance efficiencies and complicates device level integration. Herein, we report sputter deposited thin films of GeSe3, which are low loss and in which the flexible nature of the atomic structure results in thermally activated tunability in the refractive index as well as in the film’s physical volume.

We also investigate the influence of write-and-erase pulse parameters on the single-pulse recrystallization, amorphization, and readout error in our multilevel memory, thus tailoring pulse properties for optimum performance.

Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  \u0026  Co. KGaA, Weinheim  The operation of a single class of optical materials in both a volatile and nonvolatile manner is becoming increasingly important in many applications. This is particularly true in the newly emerging field of photonic neuromorphic computing, where it is desirable to have both volatile (short-term transient) and nonvolatile (long-term static) memory operation, for instance, to mimic the behavior of biological neurons and synapses. The search for such materials thus far have focused on phase change materials where typically two different types are required for the two different operational regimes. In this paper, a tunable volatile/nonvolatile response is demonstrated in a photonic phase-change memory cell based on the commonly employed nonvolatile material Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST). A time-dependent, multiphysics simulation framework is developed to corroborate the experimental results, allowing us to spatially resolve the recrystallization dynamics within the memory cell. It is then demonstrated that this unique approach to photonic memory enables both data storage with tunable volatility and detection of coincident events between two pulse trains on an integrated chip. Finally, improved efficiency and all-optical routing with controlled volatility are demonstrated in a ring resonator. These crucial results show that volatility is intrinsically tunable in normally nonvolatile GST which can be used in both regimes interchangeably.","tags":["all-optical computing","integrated all-photonic memory","phase-change materials","phase-change photonics"],"title":"Tunable Volatility of Ge2Sb2Te5 in Integrated Photonics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Fully controllable phase-change materials embedded in integrated photonic circuits are a promising platform for on-chip reconfigurable devices. Successful experimental demonstrations have thus far enabled non-volatile multilevel memories and switches, optical synapses, and on-chip photonic computing.

In this paper, we study qualitatively the evanescent field coupling between Ge2Sb2Te5 and the confined mode within a Si3N4 rib waveguide. To do so, we carry out simulations and compare to experimental results to reveal the switching dynamics that drives the precise control during amorphization and crystallization. Furthermore, we study the unique deterministic control of intermediate states for multilevel applications. Through better understanding of the physics behind the phase switching, optimized parameters for faster and more energy efficient devices are proposed.

Here, an optical pulse-width modulation (PWM) switching of phase-change materials on an integrated waveguide is developed, which allows practical implementation of photonic memories and logic devices.

The hybridized films show linear and reproducible responses to tensile strains, which have been applied in strain sensors to detect human motions with fast response, high sensitivity, and durability.","tags":["buckle","carbon nanotube","graphene","hybridization","strain sensing"],"title":"Graphene Reinforced Carbon Nanotube Networks for Wearable Strain Sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Seamless and minimally invasive three-dimensional interpenetration of electronics within artificial or natural structures could allow for continuous monitoring and manipulation of their properties. Flexible electronics provide a means for conforming electronics to non-planar surfaces, yet targeted delivery of flexible electronics to internal regions remains difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by demonstrating the syringe injection (and subsequent unfolding) of sub-micrometre-thick, centimetre-scale macroporous mesh electronics through needles with a diameter as small as 100μm. Our results show that electronic components can be injected into man-made and biological cavities, as well as dense gels and tissue, with 90% device yield. We demonstrate several applications of syringe-injectable electronics as a general approach for interpenetrating flexible electronics with three-dimensional structures, including (1) monitoring internal mechanical strains in polymer cavities, (2) tight integration and low chronic immunoreactivity with several distinct regions of the brain, and (3) in vivo multiplexed neural recording. Moreover, syringe injection enables the delivery of flexible electronics through a rigid shell, the delivery of large-volume flexible electronics that can fill internal cavities, and co-injection of electronics with other materials into host structures, opening up unique applications for flexible electronics.","tags":[],"title":"Syringe-injectable electronics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z. -J.

By using a laser beam to deposit heat locally, irradiated polymer instantaneously melts and vaporizes. During laser drilling of the polymer, the single-layer graphene membrane adheres to the polymer surface and consequently forms tens of nanometer deep wells. Due to the short time scale of laser irradiation, heat diffusion in the polymer is negligible, and the excitation energy is highly confined in the polymer. As a result, graphene nanowells of hundreds of nanometers in diameter can be patterned with high fidelity. With the increasing of nanowell density, we observe the spontaneous formation of nanowrinkles connecting pairs of nanowells in the graphene membranes. Importantly, Raman spectra confirm that no defects are introduced in graphene membranes by laser irradiation under our experimental conditions.

The underlining physical reason is that the intrinsic carrier density of a device made from a traditional semiconductor material increases very fast with a rising temperature. Once reaching a temperature, the density surpasses the chemical doping or gating effect, any p-n junction or transistor made from the semiconductor will fail to function. Here, we measure the intrinsic Fermi level (|E F | = 2.93k B T) or intrinsic carrier density (n in = 3.87 × 10 6 cm -2 K -2 ·T 2 ), carrier drift velocity, and G mode phonon energy of graphene devices and their temperature dependencies up to 2400 K. Our results show intrinsic carrier density of graphene is an order of magnitude less sensitive to temperature than those of Si or Ge, and reveal the great potentials of graphene as a material for high temperature devices. We also observe a linear decline of saturation drift velocity with increasing temperature, and identify the temperature coefficients of the intrinsic G mode phonon energy. Above knowledge is vital in understanding the physical phenomena of graphene under high power or high temperature.","tags":[],"title":"Graphene, a material for high temperature devices - Intrinsic carrier density, carrier drift velocity, and lattice energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T. -M.

Here, we report the design, fabrication, and demonstration of intracellular bioelectronic devices with probe sizes less than 10 nm. The devices are based on a nanowire-nanotube heterostructure in which a nanowire field-effect transistor detector is synthetically integrated with a nanotube cellular probe. Sub-10-nm nanotube probes were realized by a two-step selective etching approach that reduces the diameter of the nanotube freeend while maintaining a larger diameter at the nanowire detector necessary for mechanical strength and electrical sensitivity. Quasistatic water-gate measurements demonstrated selective device response to solution inside the nanotube, and pulsed measurements together with numerical simulations confirmed the capability to record fast electrophysiological signals. Systematic studies of the probe bandwidth in different ionic concentration solutions revealed the underlying mechanism governing the time response. In addition, the bandwidth effect of phospholipid coatings, which are important for intracellular recording, was investigated and modeled. The robustness of these sub-10-nm bioelectronics probes for intracellular interrogation was verified by optical imaging and recording the transmembrane resting potential of HL-1 cells. These ultrasmall bioelectronic probes enable direct detection of cellular electrical activity with highest spatial resolution achieved to date, and with further integration into larger chip arrays could provide a unique platform for ultra-high-resolution mapping of activity in neural networks and other systems.","tags":[],"title":"Sub-10-nm intracellular bioelectronic probes from nanowire-nanotube heterostructures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.

Yet, the consequences of size-reduction on fundamental noise limits, or minimum resolvable signals, and their impact on device design considerations have not been defined. Here, we address these key issues by quantifying the size-dependent performance and limiting factors of graphene (Gra) transducers under physiological conditions. We show that suspended Gra devices represent the optimal configuration for cardiac extracellular electrophysiology in terms of both transducer sensitivity, systematically ∼5× higher than substrate-supported devices, and forming tight bioelectronic interfaces. Significantly, noise measurements on free-standing Gra together with theoretical calculations yield a direct relationship between low-frequency 1/f noise and water dipole-induced disorders, which sets fundamental sensitivity limits for Gra devices in physiological media. As a consequence, a square-root-of-area scaling of Gra transducer sensitivity was experimentally revealed to provide a critical design rule for their implementation in bioelectronics. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","tags":["Graphene","electrophysiology","noise","scaling","sensor"],"title":"Sensitivity limits and scaling of bioelectronic graphene transducers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.
