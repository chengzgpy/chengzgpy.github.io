 abstract = {Phase change materials are increasingly becoming important functional materials for applications in emerging integrated optics. Since the demonstration of a photonic phase change memory device in 2015, several new applications i this area have emerged ranging from lossless routing to on-chip photonics synapses. More recently the use of these materials in unconventional computing has seen an emerging interest, especially in the areas of optical abacuses and other forms of brain-inspired computing. There have also been advances in non-von Neumann approaches to carry out large-scale matrix multiplications. In this talk, I shall cover these topics and present a future view of these materials, not only in computation, but also in displays and holographic projections.},
