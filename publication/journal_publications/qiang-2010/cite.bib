 abstract = {Suspended graphene devices are successfully fabricated by using a novel PMMA/MMA/PMMA tri-layer resist technique. The gap between graphene and dielectric substrate can be easily controlled by the thickness of the bottom PMMA layer, and no wet-etching with hazardous hydrofluoric acid is involved in our fabrication process. Electrical characterizations on suspended graphene devices are performed in vacuum when in-situ current annealing directly leads to a significant improvement on transport properties of graphene, i.e., the increase of carrier mobility with the reduction of width of Dirac peak. Our results make a new opportunity to study intrinsic properties of graphene. Â© 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.},
