 abstract = {We report studies on surface modification of graphene with 1-octadecanethiol and its application as heavy metal sensors. The alkanethiol molecules can self-assemble into large-scale highly ordered monolayers on single-layer graphene regardless of the roughness of graphene surfaces inherited from the underlying amorphorous silicon oxide (SiO2) dielectric substrates. Atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy imaging of modified graphene sheets on SiO2 was conducted to reveal configuration details of the self-assembled structure. Functionalization of graphene field effect transistors (Gra-FETs) with 1-octadecanethiol was realized and successfully explored for mercury(II) (Hg2+) detection at 10 ppm.
