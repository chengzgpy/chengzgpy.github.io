 abstract = {We report in-depth studies of nanostructures formed in graphene on soft substrates. Periodic buckles with amplitude of nanometer scale spontaneously appear at edges of single-layer membranes after cooling of samples from above the substrate's glass-transition temperature. Stress modulation at step-edges between single- and few-layer further induces penetrating nanobuckles into the few-layer. The evolvement of single-layer folding into double and triple-layer stacks at elevated temperature was also probed in detail, and we show that the developed interfaces are clear of polymer contamination. Our results underscore the possibility to construct diverse nanostructures and to design novel devices based on graphene. Â© 2009 American Chemical Society.},
