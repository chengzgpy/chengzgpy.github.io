 abstract = {Structural color filters (i.e. plasmonics and nano-cavities) provide vivid and robust color filtering in applications such as CMOS image sensors but lack simplicity in fabrication and dynamic tuning. Here we report a dynamically tunable, transmissive color filter by incorporating an ultra-thin phase change layer inside a thin-film optical resonator. The transmitted color spectrum can be designed over the entire visible range and shifted by around 50&#x2005;nm after phase transition. Angle dependence shows little color variation within a &#x00B1;30&#x00B0; viewing angle. Crucially, only film deposition is required to fabricate our phase change color filter, showing great potential for large-scale and inexpensive production. The dynamically tunable color filter, described in this paper, could be a promising component in display, CMOS sensor, and solar cell technology.},
