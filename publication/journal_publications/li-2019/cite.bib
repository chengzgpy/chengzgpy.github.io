 abstract = {© 2019 Optical Society of America.  Optically storing and addressing data on photonic chips is of particular interest as such capability would eliminate optoelectronic conversion losses in data centers. It would also enable on-chip non-von Neumann photonic computing by allowing multinary data storage with high fidelity. Here, we demonstrate such an optically addressed, multilevel memory capable of storing up to 34 nonvolatile reliable and repeatable levels (over 5 bits) using the phase change material Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 integrated on a photonic waveguide. Crucially, we demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a technique that allows us to program the device with a single pulse regardless of the previous state of the material, providing an order of magnitude improvement over previous demonstrations in terms of both time and energy consumption. We also investigate the influence of write-and-erase pulse parameters on the single-pulse recrystallization, amorphization, and readout error in our multilevel memory, thus tailoring pulse properties for optimum performance. Our work represents a significant step in the development of photonic memories and their potential for novel integrated photonic applications.},
